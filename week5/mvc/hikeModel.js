// normally the model would have more going on...retrieving the hikes from a database, filtering, etc. Our model will be very simple.  We could simply export the hikeList, but a better pattern would be to create a 'getter' function to do it instead. That way as our model changed...we could simply change the getter function and anything using it should be able to remain the same.
const hikeList = [
